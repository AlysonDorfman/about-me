      . I'm originally from Seattle, WA. After graduating college from the University of Washington, I spent two years more in Seattle and then moved down to California. Right before moving, I met my now husband and convinced him to move to California as well - good thing it all worked out! We now have a 2 year old daughter. My career thus far has been in business development within healthcare. Through Code Fellows, I intend to pivot into Software Engineering. Looking forward to learning a lot here!
